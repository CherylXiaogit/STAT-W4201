## HW 4

Consider the Boston dataset, in R library MASS, on Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston.

### Problem 1

> (a). Fit a multiple linear regression model to predict medv (median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s) using the following set of predictors
- crim per capita crime rate by town.
- zn proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- indus proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- nox nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).    
- rm average number of rooms per dwelling.    
- age proportion of owner\-occupied units built prior to 1940.    
- tax full\-value property\-tax rate per $10,000.    

> (b). State and assess the validity of the underlying assumptions, 
and suggest remedial measures in case of violations of any of the underlying assumptions
- Linearity/functional form
- Normality
- Homoscedasticity
- Uncorrelated error

> (c). Repeat (a) using Least Median of Squares Regression and compare the results with those obtained in (a).
