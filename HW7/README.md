## HW 7

Consider the ChickWeightdata in R. 
The body weights of the chicks were measured at birth (i.e., time=0) and every second day thereafter until day 20. 
They were also measured on day 21. There were four groups of chicks on different protein diets.

### Problem 1
#### Consider comparing Diet Levels 1 and 4 on Day 21.
> - (a). Determine whether there is association between Diet and Weight, 
using logistic regression, without adjusting for Birth Weight. 
Interpret what the estimated parameters denote.

> - (b). Repeat (a) adjusting for Birth Weight. Interpret what the estimated parameters denote.

### Problem 2
> Repeat 1 for all 4 Diet Levels.

### Problem 3
> Repeat 1 using the L-1 regularized logistic regression.
