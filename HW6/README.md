## HW 6

Consider the ChickWeight data in R. 
The body weights of the chicks were measured at birth (i.e., time=0) and every second day thereafter until day 20. 
They were also measured on day 21. There were four groups of chicks on different protein diets.

### Problem 1
> 1. Determine whether there is a significant difference in the mean weights of the four groups on Day 18.

> 2. Check the validity of your assumptions, including parallelism. 
Suggest measures that you would take if the assumptions are not satisfied.

### Problem 2
> 1. Perform an appropriate repeated measures ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference 
in the mean weights of the four groups using the measurements on Days 10, 18, and 21.
> 2. Check the validity of your assumptions.
