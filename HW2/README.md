## HW 2

Consider the crabs data frame in R library MASS which has 200 rows and 8 columns,
describing 5 morphological measurements on 50 crabs each of two color forms 
("B" or "O" for blue or orange) and both sexes, of the species Leptograpsus variegatus 
collected at Fremantle, W. Australia. data(crabs, package="MASS")

### Problem 1

> Determine whether there is a significant difference between blue and orange crabs 
in mean carapace length (mm) [CL] using each of the following procedures:
- (a). A parametric procedure
- (b). A non-parametric procedure
- (c). A re-sampling procedure

### Problem 2
> Discuss the assumptions underlying the analyses in (1) above, their validity, and any remedial measures to be taken.

### Problem 3
> Ramsey and Schafer (2nd ed., p. 576), Data Problem 17 (Alcohol Consumption and Breast Cancer).

### Problem 4
> Ramsey and Schafer (2nd ed., p. 550 Data Problem 18 (Hale-Bopp and Handedness).
